    <h1>How to Add CSS to HTML: Understanding Inline, Internal & External CSS</h1>
    <p>If you’re building a website, HTML is your best friend. With it, you creat all of your page content, including headings, paragraphs, images, tables, forms, lists, and so on. However, you can’t control how these elements look on the page, at least not with HTML alone. That’s why we have CSS.CSS determines how the contents of a web page look when shown in browser. It can be used for a huge range of stylistic purposes, from changing colors and animating elements to determining the whole layout of your page.</p>
