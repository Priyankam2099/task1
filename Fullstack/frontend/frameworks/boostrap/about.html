    <h1>Flipkart</h1>
    <p>Flipkart Private Limited is an Indian e-commerce company, headquartered in Bengaluru, and incorporated in Singapore as a private limited company. The company initially focused on online book sales before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials, groceries, and lifestyle products.

        The service competes primarily with Amazon India and domestic rival Snapdeal.[5][6] As of March 2017, Flipkart held a 39.5% market share in the Indian e-commerce industry.[7] Flipkart has a dominant position in the apparel segment, bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra, and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.[8]
        
        In August 2018, American retail chain Walmart acquired a 77% controlling stake in Flipkart for US$16 billion, valuing Flipkart at around US$20 billion.[9] Flipkart is valued at $37.6 billion as of 2022.[10] It is planning to go public through a listing in the United States of America in 2023.[11]

        <h4>History</h4>
        Flipkart was founded in October 2007 by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, alumni of the IIT, Delhi and former Amazon employees.[12][13][14] The company initially focused on online book sales with country-wide shipping. Flipkart slowly grew in prominence and was receiving 100 orders per day by 2008.[15]

Growth, Mergers and Acquisitions

In 2010, Flipkart acquired the Bangalore-based social book discovery service WeRead from Lulu.com.[16]

In 2011, Flipkart acquired the digital distribution business Mime360.com[17] and the digital content library of the Bollywood portal Chakpak.[18] Following the acquisition, Flipkart launched their DRM-free online music store Flyte in 2012. Due to competition from free streaming sites, Flyte was unsuccessful and shut down in June 2013.[19][20][21][22]

With its eyes on India's retail market, Flipkart acquired Letsbuy, an online electronics retailer,[23] in 2012, and Myntra, an online fashion retailer, for US$280 million in May 2014.[24] Myntra continues to operate alongside Flipkart as a standalone subsidiary focusing on separate market segments.
